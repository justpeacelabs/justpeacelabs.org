Our mission is to harness the power of technology to advance just and
sustainable peace in post-conflict countries. We use technology to support
participatory peace processes that empower citizens to engage in a just
transition to peace. We provide local and international peacebuilders access
to innovative tools that facilitate more inclusive, holistic and
context-specific peace processes.
