Our mission is to unleash the power of technology to advance just and
sustainable peace in post-conflict countries. We support participatory peace
processes that empower citizens to engage with a just transition to peace. We
provide local and international peacebuilders access to innovative tools that
facilitate more inclusive, holistic, and context-specific peace processes.
