    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>JustPeace Labs supports the adoption of technology tools by peacebuilders
      working in post-conflict situations.</p>

    <p>Our innovative tools and software help peacebuilders undertake more
      context-relevant peacebuilding programs that facilitate meaningful
      participation of affected communities, local ownership and inclusion, and broad
      access. We assist peacebuilders in empowering local communities to be active
      participants in creating lasting just peace.</p>

    <p>Challenges to using technology in peacebuilding include ethics, access and
      capacity. We aim to overcome these challenges through our holistic, open
      approach. In particular, we hope to contribute to the following outcomes:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>An ethical and secure approach to using technology in peacebuilding.</li>
      <li>Improving
        peacebuilders’ access to technological tools, focusing on easy-to-use and
        open-source software.</li>
      <li>Enhancing technological literacy and capacity to build
        and use tools for just and sustainable peace.</li>
