    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <article class="post-content prose-home">
      <p>JustPeace Labs supports the adoption of technology tools by peacebuilders
        working in post-conflict situations.</p>

      <p>Our innovative tools and software help peacebuilders undertake more
        context-relevant peacebuilding programs that facilitate meaningful
        participation of affected communities, local ownership and inclusion, and broad
        access. We assist peacebuilders in empowering local communities to be active
        participants in creating lasting just peace.</p>

      <p>Challenges to using technology in peacebuilding include ethics, access and
        capacity. We aim to overcome these challenges through our holistic, open
        approach. In particular, we hope to contribute to the following outcomes:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>An ethical and secure approach to using technology in peacebuilding.</li>
        <li>Improving
          peacebuildersâ€™ access to technological tools, focusing on easy-to-use and
          open-source software.</li>
        <li>Enhancing technological literacy and capacity to build
          and use tools for just and sustainable peace.</li>
      </ol>
