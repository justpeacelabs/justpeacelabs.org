    We’ve been busy and productive at JustPeace Labs these past few months! We are hard at work on a program to overcome hate crimes in the US, have partnered with a Build Up Fellow on developing an app in Myanamar, and published draft guidelines on Ethical Peace Tech. Here’s what we’ve been up to.

    **Tracking Hate Crimes in the United States**

    There has been a recent spike in hate crimes reported in the United States. [According to the FBI,](https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2015-hate-crime-statistics-released) there was an overall increase in hate crimes in the US in 2015, including an alarming 67% increase in hate crimes against Muslims and a surge in attacks against transgender people. However, there is a[ severe shortage of data](http://www.salon.com/2016/11/20/yes-hate-crimes-are-up-but-the-government-is-not-keeping-good-track-of-them_partner/) about hate crimes.

    Hate crimes threaten the safety of our families and the fabric of our communities. Hatred and division in communities can also lead to violent conflict, crimes against humanity and human rights violations. This is not to suggest that this that could or would happen in the US, but experiences around the world demonstrate that small ruptures in the fabric of our society can grow exponentially and violently, seemingly overnight.

    To address these challenges, we developed [HateTracker](http://app.hatetracker.org), a web-based app for tracking and reporting hate incidents. Using HateTracker, anyone can securely report information and submit photos or recordings of hate incidents they experience or witness.

    With the data gathered by HateTracker, we will be able to identify when, where and how hate incidents are being committed. Knowledge is power and with this valuable data, we can take positive action to combat hate incidents in our communities and create a safer, more inclusive and more just society.

    **Rumor Reporting and Verification in Myanmar**

    In recent years, Myanmar has experienced a surge in inter-communal violence. This violence is often spurred by rumors, which are frequently untrue. We are proud to be working with Maude Morrison [Build Peace Fellow](http://howtobuildpeace.org/fellows/) and manager of the Early Warning Early Response (EWER) Program for the[ Center for Diversity and National Harmony](http://www.cdnh.org/) (CDNH) in Myanmar on an app to track and verify rumors.

    The app will allow CDNH’s local monitors to report rumors and communal tensions, check and verify rumors reported in other communities and comment on or upload evidence for or against the rumor. It is hoped that the app will foster greater inclusiveness and connections among the network of monitors and help CDNH provide more accurate and timely information to communities stakeholders in Myanmar about the veracity of reported rumors. Ultimately, the app will contribute to reducing potential outbreaks of violence.

    **Ethical PeaceTech**

    Besides technology, we’ve been focusing on the ethics of using technology in peacebuilding. Peacebuilders are rapidly turning to technology to augment their work. This raises wide-reaching ethical considerations and concerns regarding the protection of user privacy and security.

    Faced with our own ethical challenges, we sought a guide or checklist that would help us navigate the tricky ins and outs of ethical peacetech. We did find some relevant and useful ethical guidelines and good practices ([here](https://www.icrc.org/en/publication/0999-professional-standards-protection-work-carried-out-humanitarian-and-human-rights),[ here](http://digitalprinciples.org) and[ here](https://responsibledata.io/resources/handbook/), for example). But we didn’t find anything totally on-point—something that focused specifically on the practical needs of peacebuilders working in conflict and post-conflict situations.

    So what did we decide to do? Write one ourselves. And at [Build Peace](http://howtobuildpeace.org) this year, we hosted a workshop on[ Ethical Guidelines for PeaceTech](http://howtobuildpeace.org/ethical-peacetech/).

    Based on consultations with experts in the technology and peacebuilding fields, our Ethical Guidelines for PeaceTech is a practical tool that can be consulted when starting an ICT project in a conflict-sensitive area. Our guidelines include a checklist for practitioners in the field on ethical considerations as well as a list of resources they can turn to on ethics and security.

    We’re currently getting feedback and input from security and ethics experts, and next year look forward to releasing a final version!

    There is an increasingly well-recognized and vivid need among peacebuilders for increased access to technological tools that can advance their efforts. However, peacebuilders across sectors are confronted by resource, time, and capacity constraints that often make it difficult or impossible to efficiently use technological tools in their program design, implementation, and analysis.

    Additional challenges to peacebuilding more generally include creating programs that are [context-relevant, inclusive, broadly accessible, and which have widespread participation from affected
    communities](http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/67/499). There are also challenges specific to using technology in conflict and post-conflict contexts, such as weakened or destroyed mobile infrastructures, legal restrictions, insecure environments, and [ethical considerations](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techchange.org%2F2014%2F09%2F23%2Fethics-ict-technology-peacebuilding%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGAXxp1_M2iQ58WVhEExjLJK582NQ).

    JustPeace Labs addresses these challenges by offering peacebuilders a robust, user-friendly online development platform for creating targeted mobile applications.

    ### Context

    Recognizing the need for context-specific technology use, we will make it
    easier for peacebuilders to unleash the power of technology in ways that are
    designed for and with the input of the peacebuilding community to ensure each
    application is situation-specific. Our development platform will also address
    difficult challenges specific to using technology in post-conflict settings,
    such as the ethics and security of using mobile apps in peacebuilding work, and
    the inequalities in access to technological tools amongst local communities.

    ### Access

    By creating a robust and easy-to-use tool for mobile application development,
    more organizations and peacebuilders will have access to the benefits of
    technology. Based online and designed for non-technical users, the application
    will increase access to technological tools amongst traditionally harder to
    reach constituencies, such as
    [women](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2014/05/women-ict-africa-new-digital-ga-201452210244121558.html)
    and rural communities. Grassroots organizations will not need special software,
    equipment, or technical capacity to use our platform. Anyone, anywhere, can use
    it.

    ### Inclusion & Participation

    It will also allow peacebuilders to reach larger groups of people, collect
    better information, engage in more in-depth analysis, and do so quickly, in
    peacebuilding contexts where timing is critical and resources are scarce. With
    more people able to design mobile apps specific to their context and goals,
    more people will be included in the peace process. This will generate a new
    social infrastructure where communities feel more connected to peacebuilding
    programs, and more invested in seeing their success.

    ### Empowerment

    Our app development platform is designed to empower local civil society
    organizations, which may lack the capacity to design similar tools in-house, to
    be able to use technology in their work. By increasing direct access to
    peacebuilding programs, local civil society groups and communities will become
    empowered participants in creating peaceful societies, thereby increasing the
    [legitimacy of technology](http://howtobuildpeace.org/blog/cindy-chungong1/) in
    fragile post-conflict environments and making information sharing horizontal
    (between beneficiaries) rather than hierarchical (from beneficiaries to
    donors/implementers).

    ### How it works

    The development platform will allow peacebuilders to quickly design, create,
    and implement mobile applications to support their work. For example, an
    organization working on rule of law or governance issues will be able to gather
    information from local communities by designing a survey application using the
    platform. Another organization would be able to use the interface to create a
    mobile application to inform communities of upcoming elections information,
    town-hall meetings, security updates, or other critical information that has
    traditionally been difficult for peacebuilders to disseminate quickly and
    efficiently across communities or in rural areas. The interface could also be
    used by peacebuilders working in the field to securely collect and send data
    about crimes and human rights violations, the environment, or local economies.
    Or it could be used to create a central hub of information and communication to
    facilitate cooperation between peacebuilding organizations. The types and uses
    of the apps that can be developed on our platform are many--we will develop
    features and add-ons to be able to address the most common app types, as well
    as provide opportunities for customization.

    The platform will also include tools for easy data analysis. Peacebuilders will
    be able to gather data from their mobile applications or other sources, such as
    government open data. It will be easy to analyze information and create visuals
    to support findings and reports, improve advocacy and awareness-raising
    efforts, or measure the impact of their programs.

    The interface will be intuitive and will require very little training and no
    technological expertise to operate. The applications will be web-based, and
    therefore will work across mobile platforms (such as Android, iOS, FirefoxOS,
    and others). There will be built-in features unique to peacebuilding contexts,
    such as language support, image/shape support (for example to allow
    communication with illiterate users), encryption, verification, and data
    analysis. We will also offer opportunities to customize the platform to the
    needs of specific organizations through an extendable plugin system.

    Our project will use the global reach of the web and its latest developments to
    build a platform that everyone can use, from any device or system. In
    particular, our project will take advantage of the following technologies:

    * **HTML5**. The web was conceived as a "universal" medium with no walled gardens owned by major platforms or corporations. This idea informs the premise of our project. We will be using HTML5 and the latest web technologies to create a global reach, making sure we leverage features like offline-capability (Appcache, service workers) to provide service to areas with low-connectivity. Our tools will work on every device.

    * **SMS-based interfaces.** Using services like Twilio or Frontline SMS, our platform will allow peacebuilders to reach people living in low or 0-connectivity areas.

    * **Modular, pluggable architecture.** We intend to design the system with a modular architecture so that once the project is open-sourced people and organizations can easily build plugins for their use-cases.

    * **Integration with existing tools and workflows.** Peacebuilders will not have to learn a whole new application and interface to utilize this tool. Instead it can be integrated with existing software like Google Docs or LibreOffice.

    In this way, JustPeace Labs brings the power of technological tools to the
    global community of peacebuilders and in turn increases inclusivity and local
    ownership of peacebuilding initiatives. We welcome your ideas and feedback.

    JustPeace Labs is proud to announce the release of [Ethical Guidelines for PeaceTech](https://goo.gl/33bWR3), the first in its series of practical guidelines for PeaceTech stakeholders.

    <!--more-->

    Peacebuilding programs are increasingly turning to technology--specifically information communications technology, or ICT--to connect with and assist local communities in post-conflict contexts. It is widely acknowledged that although ICT provides great promise in peacebuilding, there are also significant risks and ethical considerations that must be taken into account before using technology in these contexts.

    Experts have created a number of relevant and useful ethical guidelines and good practices ([here](https://www.icrc.org/en/publication/0999-professional-standards-protection-work-carried-out-humanitarian-and-human-rights), [here](http://digitalprinciples.org) and [here](https://responsibledata.io/resources/handbook/), for example), and the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative has recently released a [human rights approach](https://signalcode.org/code-intro/) to using technology in humanitarian responses to crisis.

    However, there is still a need for a practical guide to ethical peacetech. Something that peacebuilding practitioners can turn to when planning and executing ICT programs, that software programmers can rely on when tackling complex coding challenges, that private corporations can utilize when operating in post-conflict contexts, and that funders can turn to when deciding how to fund peacetech work.

    This is why we are developing a core set of practical guidelines for peacetech:

    1. Ethical Guidelines for PeaceTech

    2. Ethical Coding for PeaceTech Programmers

    3. Ethical ICT Business Practices for Post-Conflict States

    4. Ethical Guidelines for Funding PeaceTech Projects

    With our first guide, peacebuilders and development specialists who want to use ICT in their work can find guidance on answering questions like:

    * What exactly are our ethical obligations to our users?

    * How do we get informed consent in a way that users can truly understand?

    * How can we better understand how the local context where we’re working impacts our work--and our data?

    * What data can we ethically collect? What data *should* we collect

    * How can we make sure we are not putting our users at risk?

    * Is there anything we need to make sure our programmers do (or don’t) put into the code?

    * How can we protect our users if we have to, or decide to, share our data with third parties?

    The guide is loosely organized by a program or project lifecycle. The first section introduces ethical, privacy and security challenges that arise when using ICT in peacebuilding or post-conflict contexts. It also discusses steps to take in order to understand the context in which you are working and how to be inclusive and avoid bias in data collection. The second section presents considerations for how to meet ethical obligations in practice, from the planning and strategy phase onward.  The guide also includes a list of resources for more detailed information on the themes addressed.

    Future guides will tackle similar issues targeted to different PeaceTech stakeholders, including software engineers, private corporations and funders. Each will be written with needs and interests of each user group in mind, and in consultation with industry experts.

    Together, we hope that this comprehensive set of guidelines will help promote the ethical use of ICT in post-conflict contexts.

    We’re stoked to be heading back to [Build Peace](http://howtobuildpeace.org) on Friday. We’ve been hard at work since we first introduced JustPeace Labs and our [vision for inclusive peacebuilding](http://justpeacelabs.org/blog/2015-04-10/tooling-for-empowerment-and-peacebuilding//) through DIY mobile phone apps.

    * What data can we collect? What data *should* we collect?

    * What are rights to privacy in our jurisdiction(s) and for our user groups?

    * How can we avoid digital tracking of our users and their data?

    * Who "owns" the data we are using?

    * Are we putting our users at risk?

    * Is there anything we need to make sure our programmers do (or don’t) put into the code?



    Hope to see lots of familiar faces next weekend and meet new PeaceTechies too!

    We’ve finally had a moment to collect our thoughts after a stimulating weekend
    in Cyprus at the Build Peace 2015 conference. <!--more-->We were blown away by the
    enthusiasm of conference participants and the wealth of expertise and ideas
    being shared! We were also left with a number of burning questions...

    ### Where are all the programmers?

    Many conference participants highlighted similar challenges to using technology
    in peacebuilding. Some of these include needing to decide between targeting
    "low-level" versus “high-level” technology (e.g., feature vs. smartphones), how
    to process and manage large quantities of data and avoid fragmentation and how
    to seamlessly reach all of the different devices out there.

    Some of these challenges can be addressed by utilizing open technologies like
    Firefox OS and proven solutions to process big data that are already successful
    in the private sector. Governments and organizations around the world are
    discovering the benefits of using [open
    data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data) and are developing insights on
    how to
    [us](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2F2014%2F08%2Fdat%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHGrbU67MaEh5o2Y2P3NHSbRdcCwg)[e](http://www.wired.com/2014/08/dat/)[
    this data for
    good](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2F2014%2F08%2Fdat%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHGrbU67MaEh5o2Y2P3NHSbRdcCwg).
    We believe open data should be ubiquitous in peace tech, so that organizations
    around the world can build on it. Also, the Internet of Things is making a big
    splash in the tech scene, and—although it is still in its infancy—we believe
    that it could contribute meaningfully to peacebuilding in the near future.

    Our Build Peace discussions would have benefited enormously from the input of
    engineers and programmers that have experience designing and implementing these
    kind of systems. There wasn’t a large presence of technologists or programmers
    at Build Peace to provide input on these and other challenges. Incentivizing
    them to become integral members of the peace tech community will be an
    important next step, followed by targeted technical discussions on potential
    solutions.

    ### What are our ethical guidelines?

    There was an overwhelming consensus about a need for the ethical application of
    technology in our peacebuilding work. Participants all seemed to agree that "do
    no harm" should be a central tenet of this field. However, more discussion is
    needed on what exactly that means and how exactly that plays out in practice.
    We need to delve into creating and applying ethical guidelines in practice. It
    is critical that these guidelines, like our projects, are scalable and do not
    become diluted as tech projects are adopted and adapted in various
    (post-)conflict situations.

    This is especially true given the discussion about the creation of a peace tech
    industry that relies on private companies (see a debate about this
    [here](http://letthemtalk.org/2015/05/08/peacetech-industry/)). There are
    important ethical implications of monetizing peacebuilding work through private
    companies, including the collection of personal data as users come online in
    post-conflict countries. One very significant risk is that post-conflict
    communities will [pay for the technology with their
    data](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/26/facebook-isnt-charity-poor-pay-by-surrending-their-data)
    -- after all, there has to be a profit incentive somewhere. How these companies
    then use that data may not be regulated or may be used in ways that are
    ethically dubious. Current laws and corporate social responsibility guidelines
    may need to be updated to take ethical and legal considerations into account.

    ### What about security?

    Working in post-conflict situations always involves security risks, as does the
    widespread use of information technology. Systems can be hacked, users can be
    targeted (by governments or others), and information can be used by spoilers to
    foment unrest and violence. As a community, security should be a primary
    consideration in developing peacebuilding programs that utilize technology. How
    can we best ensure that our tech tools are secure? What steps do we need to
    take to ensure that our tools are used securely, and how do we deal with the
    possible exploitation of our tools by peace spoilers? We should work to develop
    a set of good practices for working securely in this field.

    ### What do we do about changing regulatory frameworks?

    Finally, how do peacebuilders ensure that their work does not violate laws or
    regulatory frameworks? As technology changes and expands, so do the laws and
    regulatory frameworks that govern their use. These include changes to criminal
    laws, laws governing freedom of expression, website registration requirements,
    laws restricting encryption, laws restricting anonymization tools and many
    others.

    Moreover, technology is increasingly being used by courts and prosecutors in
    investigations and trials--sometimes limiting the potential for peacebuilding.
    For example, as peacebuilders turn to technology, [repressive states in turn
    cite that technology use as evidence of criminal
    activity](http://buildingpeaceforum.com/2015/03/the-risks-of-speaking-out-online/).

    How can peacebuilders ensure that their tech tools do not violate these legal
    and regulatory frameworks? How do we as a community help shape frameworks to
    promote openness and security? A peacebuilder working across jurisdictions will
    need to account for multiple legal systems and potential risks. Those of us
    designing programs with users across the globe will also need to ensure that
    our users understand the legal implications of their work. That doesn’t mean
    just signing an informed consent form, but really helping users understand the
    legal framework that governs technology use in their country and how they can
    best protect themselves.

    ### Moving forward

    As we move forward with our projects as a community, reflection on these issues
    will be critical. They are fundamental to a sustainable peace tech industry
    (whether "private," “public,” or somewhere in between).

    JustPeace Labs hopes to drive discussion and thought on these questions and
    challenges. We are building relationships with programmers who can help solve
    some technological challenges by using the latest advances in computer science.
    We are currently working on a white paper addressing the issue of CSR, ethics
    and peace tech. We are also engaged in research on regulatory frameworks and
    relevant laws.
